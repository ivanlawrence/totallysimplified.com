# Hello World
This is the beginning.

I like making my life easier but if something is simple yet done infrequently then it can become difficult.

Why?

## Lets totally simplify everything.

I have worked in the tech sector for decades and have always kept some notes in one way or another, I then started adding it to a blog, etc.

## Why DIY?
With AI able to seemingly answer any simple question like "how to make a hello world web page" why bother doing the old hello world?

## Simple. It feels good.
If you do it yourself you remember it, and if you accomplish something you feel good.

Okay, I hope this can help someone.
